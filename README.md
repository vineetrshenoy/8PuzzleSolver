# 8PuzzleSolver
An 8-puzzle solver using heaps (priority queues) and the A* search algorithm

This project was created as a part of Coursera's Algorithms I course from Princeton University. The full assignment specification can be found here: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html

An 8-puzzle is a classic game where the tiles 1-8 are place on a 3 x 3 grid with one empty space (the game can get bigger with tiles 1-(N^2-1) placed on a N x N grid). The objective is to get all the numbers in order, from left to right then top to bottom, by sliding the tiles into the empty space. This program simulated an 8 puzzle solver. 

First, the Board class was implemented to represent a board. The API is as follows:
